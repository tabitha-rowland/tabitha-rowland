## Hey! I'm Tabitha
# (she/they)

I studied Computer Science and English at Kalamazoo College, and I'm currently getting my MEng at Oregon State. Year 2! Woo! I graduate in June 2026.

Right now I work in LiDAR processing, which mostly involves managing data with all kinds of unique issues to solve and trying to make sense of point cloud data. Basically we make 3D maps. 

For fun, I've been getting into Stardew Valley modding. Turns out making NPCs wear hats is harder than it sounds, but I'm learning a lot about C# and game frameworks along the way.


## Things I work with

C, C#, Java, Python, HTML, Javascript, Macros, Microstation, ArcPro

Feel free to poke around my repos. Most of them are pretty old now as the bulk of my coding work is in short bursts for school assignments.
