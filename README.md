## Hey! I'm Tabitha, she/they. Welcome to my profile!

I studied Computer Science and English at Kalamazoo College, and I'm currently getting my MEng at Oregon State. Year 2! Woo! I graduate in June 2026. 

Right now I work in LiDAR processing, which mostly involves making sense of issues like the underwater points not alignining with the true profile and trying to make sense of point cloud data. Basically we make 3D maps. It's cool!

For fun, I've been getting into Stardew Valley modding. I'm learning a lot about C# and game frameworks through this (:


## Things I work with

C, C#, Java, Python, HTML, Javascript, Macros, Microstation, ArcPro

Feel free to poke around my repos. Most of them are pretty old now as the bulk of my coding work has been in short bursts for school assignments.
